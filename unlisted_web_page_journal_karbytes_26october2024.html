<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;How much is too much meditation? How much is enough meditation? What is meditation?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;Too much meditation is what feels like a waste of time to the practitioner of that meditation. Not enough meditation is the chronic condition of being unaware of one&#8217;s own motivations and internal mental workings (and hence living as a puppet controlled entirely by circumstances which are (relatively) external to one&#8217;s own mind and by authority figures other than one&#8217;s own self). <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meditation</a> is the deliberate practice of paying attention to (mostly (if not entirely) involuntary) stimuli including one&#8217;s own sensory input (e.g. visual signals and auditory signals), one&#8217;s own psychosomatic phenomena (e.g. emotions and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_load" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8216;body load&#8217;</a>), and mental activity (e.g. thoughts and dreams) and making that deliberate focusing of attention on present-moment stimuli (which are each fundamentally transient or cyclical in nature) one&#8217;s main activity during a particular time period.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Does practicing &#8216;enough&#8217; meditation increase the practitioner&#8217;s free will?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;Yes, practicing &#8216;enough&#8217; mediation (but not &#8216;too much&#8217; meditation) will lead to an increase in the practitioner&#8217;s free will; at least at the level (of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reality</a>) where free will (which is also referred to as <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agency</a>) emerges as a virtual object rendered by relatively unconscious and relatively <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/causality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deterministic</a> processes. That is because meditation frees up cognitive resources which would otherwise be spent on other processes such that the practitioner of that meditation can later (and more consciously) re-direct those cognitive resources towards processes which that practitioner thinks are more conducive to achieving that practitioner&#8217;s goals (as opposed to spending such cognitive resources in a more reflexive and less consciously-chosen manner). At sufficiently macroscopic or at sufficiently microscopic levels of information processing, free will (i.e. agency) presumably does not exist. (One corollary I could make, however, is the hypothesis I have which posits that sufficiently intelligent (or sufficiently complex) information processing agents can literally initiate deterministic causal event chains and, hence, be godlike in a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deistic</a> sense by, to some extent, willfully creating <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phenomena</a> out of literal nothingness merely by thinking and/or desiring such phenomena into existence).&#8221;</p>
