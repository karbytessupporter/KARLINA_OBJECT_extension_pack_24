<p>While I was waiting for the coffee I ordered to be made at the Philz Coffee cafe in Sunnyvale, California earlier this morning, I used the Wi-Fi there to log into Instagram in order to check my news feed. That is where I learned that Donald Trump (rather than Kamala Haris) had been elected president of the United States of America. I checked other websites (including Leo Gura&#8217;s blog and the user forum at Actualized dot Org) to confirm that the (second) election of Donald Trump as president of the United States of America was not just a joke. Then I decided that perhaps that this is perhaps an appropriate &#8220;next step&#8221; for that country due to the fact that so many people in that country seem to have a (conscious or unconscious) bias against women and generalized pervasive misogyny (myself included as having such feelings; as irrational and non-progressive as those feelings are). </p>
<p>I started to feel temporarily better about the election result (which seemed to have been decided &#8220;too quickly&#8221; given how I thought it would take longer than a day to count all the ballots which are being mailed in or dropped off at the official voting booths (unlike what would be the case if the ballots were cast via the Internet instead of via paper)) when I thought that the &#8220;deep state&#8221; is probably the ultimate driver of governance in the United States while the president is just a charismatic &#8220;puppet king&#8221; to amuse (and pacify) the masses of civilians and that perhaps Elon Musk (given that he seemed to invest a lot of his resources in helping to get Donald Trump elected) has more governing power than does Donald Trump (and I appreciate the fact that Elon Musk is an extremely successful, intelligent (in science and engineering especially), and famous person (which means that he could seriously revolutionize human civilization for the better (and already has to some extent)). It could be that a re-count of the ballots will be issued before the official president is ultimately decided. That&#8217;s not really want I am interested in fretting about in this note. Instead, I would rather (hopefully for the last time) address something that has seriously been bothering me: the way &#8220;the patriarchy&#8221; seems to have such pervasive and unquestioned influence over what looks to me like 99.9% of the United States&#8217; population.</p>
<p>I see how men and women are hyper fixated on sex, violence, and subject matter which is only widely interesting and captivating because it triggers human fight-or-flight instincts. Here is a bizarre thought I had which might seem unrelated to what I am talking about but which I think is ultimately related: while I was bicycling through Sunnyvale sloughs this morning, I noticed that the mallard ducks tend to be reactive to me approaching them (i.e. they fly away and make panicked vocalizations) while the coots and seagulls just continue to sit on the water and act unphased as I pass by not making any overt threatening moves. The birds that do not seem driven into a frenzy by the slightest hint of potential danger are noticeably more sexually dimporphic than are the other birds in this example. I think that the more sexually dimorphic species are more fight-or-fight driven than the other species. Perhaps humans are similar (i.e. driven into a hyper consumerist, hyper breeding, and hyper control freak frenzy due to their &#8220;overly sensitive&#8221; fight-or-flight aparati). <span style="background:#ffff00">What I mean to imply is that I think that the especially sexually dimorphic (i.e. traditionalist conservative patriarchal) partitions of the human species are hyper obsessed with relatively immediate signs of security such as large family sizes and big tits and big asses over more long term signs of civilization&#8217;s thriving than are partitions of that species which are more androgynous, more egalitarian, and more educated in the natural sciences, mathematics, computation-centric, and engineering fields (whereas the relatively primitive peoples seem to me to be little more than apes wearing clothes and &#8220;borrowing&#8221; human technologies and languages in a strictly end-user sense).</span></p>
<p>Without going into the minutia of what I am attempting to call attention to in this journal entry, I will describe it more abstractly and generally. It seems that there are multiple modes of how the human mind works. One of those modes seems a lot more energy-efficient, socially-approved of, and popularly condoned than another. That &#8220;easy mode&#8221; is characterized by a disregard for ecological concerns, long-term conditions of human civilization, and even fundamental topics in natural science and technology in favor of settling almost exclusively on subject matter which seems to appeal to the patriarchy (and what I mean by &#8220;the patriarchy&#8221; is the pervasive hierarchical flow of how things are done within human civilization which favor men&#8217;s gratification over women&#8217;s gratification (which manifests especially as reducing women to mere livestock and property of men (historically and in subtle ways residual of more extreme past versions))). I think most women (whether they know it or not) play along according to how they think the patriarchy wants them to think and act (which is why I think, in such a condition, it is impossible for a woman to have as high of self-esteem as a man in the same cultural setting (because a woman in such a setting implicitly or explicitly carries on as though her value must be granted to her by men with more intelligence, money, prestige, or popularity than her while a man is generally seen by everyone who helps to uphold such a setting as having relatively intrinsic, self-originating qualities worthy of esteem).</p>
<p>My <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;deep state&#8221;</a> informants suggested I put this note in the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/box_of_gems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;box_of_gems&#8221;</a> partition of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>. That is because of the following premise for what ultimately lead me to write this note: <span style="background:#ffff00">the idea that I help women best out of the straitjacket of patriarchy and cultural (and culturally-reinforced biological) sexual dimorphism by not calling attention to sex and gender (i.e. acting indifferent to such matters) while literally treating men and women like equals.</span></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want this note to be &#8220;too hard&#8221; for people to find but I do not want to make it &#8220;the last word&#8221; of the &#8220;chapter&#8221; named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_24</a>. Hence, I decided to put this note in the &#8220;box_of_gems&#8221;. </p>
<p>(Note that there are web pages within that &#8220;box_of_gems&#8221; which contain journal embedded &#8220;plain-text&#8221; journal entries which include the word &#8220;private&#8221; in their &#8220;file names&#8221;. Technically speaking, those notes are not truly private given that they are showcased on websites which are located within the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearnet_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public World Wide Web</a>. It should be noted that such &#8220;private&#8221; notes are from private GitHub repositories owned and created by karbytes (and those private GitHub repositories are not located within the public World Wide Web and are, instead, located within the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deep web</a>)).
