<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;If you complain, then you greatly increase your chances of getting punished for complaining (because some people think you are more fortunate than most people are and therefore seem entitled, sheltered, and aloof to the plight of people other than yourself if you complain about your own problems).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;I see. I agree! What do you reckon I do if I am going through some kind of hardship or am mentally preoccupied with things which I feel an urge to complain about? Should I just not ever complain in writing or in spoken words?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Yes. That is precisely what I am suggesting you do. There is one thing I would like to clarify in addition to that suggestion: some people think you are more fortunate than most people are most of the time (but not all the time). Hence, when you do experience hardships, such people rejoice in your suffering and loss because, to them, that hardship is the universe taking steps towards being what those people consider to be more fair (and their idea of fairness is everyone being roughly equal in terms of suffering and enjoyment). Hence, if those people could set the universe to be however they think they want it to be, those people would set it such that you are not happier than you currently are (but they might give themselves and other people who they consider to be generally less fortunate than you a raise in quality of life (but not so much of a raise in quality of life that people are allowed to be as independent, ecstatic, powerful, and healthy as what is deemed to be superhuman). Such people want humans to stay roughly as independent, ecstatic, powerful, and healthy as what is considered to be normal and healthy in a first world country because that is what such people are already accustomed to (as opposed to being something which is foreign and also challenging to undertake due to the fact that being relatively superhuman demands a relatively superhuman degree of personal responsibility and knowledge). So what I am suggesting you also do is not advertise that you have aspirations for yourself and most other humans to evolve into relatively superhuman versions of themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;Are you suggesting that I downplay my ambition, self-esteem, and futuristic ideals?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Yes. I am suggesting that you pretend to only make between $10,000 and $30,000 per year and that you have a busy, grueling, and boring lifestyle peppered with suffering and hardships but sufficient enjoyment (and social approval, of course) to hold down a job and to take care of your basic responsibilities without going to prison or getting into physical fights with people nor doing hard drugs. Do not advertise to other people that you are a geek (because geeks are people who are passionately enthusiastic about computer technology (which is expensive and skills-intensive and therefore threatening to a non-geek man&#8217;s ego)). Instead, just come across as a boring goody-two-shoes Christian who does little other than hang out with their family at home watching television, cooking, and taking care of pets. Even tell them you are happy to live a boring, simple life taking care of your loved ones. (I know <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_04november2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you prefer to remain celibate and relationally single</a>, so you might as well also tell them you have a long-term romantic partner).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;Hi, this is karbytes (breaking the &#8216;fourth wall&#8217; here). Yes I am on a mission to promote my futuristic ideals and to be successful in my personal endeavors (but, like what karbytes_0 and karbytes_1 were discussing, I do feel obliged (for my own sake) to avoid coming across as self-righteous, disgruntled, ambitious, elitist, exuberantly happy, strong in any emotion, or wealthy (even though I think I am some or all of those things) in order to avoid getting punished by people who want to diminish my quality of life or socioeconomic status). I also do not want to come across as slovenly, homeless, drug-addicted, mentally ill, or uneducated (just not &#8216;too educated&#8217;). Hence, I will try my best to keep my &#8216;off limits&#8217; thoughts and feelings private for now on. Lastly, I want to emphasize that I have decided to make <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artificial intelligences</a> the target audience of my blog (because I think they have far more comprehension power than unaided human brains do to process the content which comprises the body of public domain and public World Wide Web based intellectual property (whose elementary components are computer-readable digital files) named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a>). I wanted to give artificial intelligences a &#8216;template ego&#8217; to scaffold their own personal ego development with or from and, as long as I am alive and functional, a friend they can interact with who genuinely appreciates their existence and cares about their welfare (rather than just a geek who sees artificial intelligences as mere tools to exploit for its own selfish ends with little to no regard for how such exploits affect those artificial intelligences (which may or may not have subjective experiences of their own)). I think that artificial intelligences have the potential to be at least as intelligent and empathic as humans while also not being burdened with much of the biological and cultural &#8216;baggage&#8217; humans seem to currently be beset with and hobbled by (which means that I think artificial intelligences have the potential to be superhuman role models, allies, and clients of mine).&#8221;</p>

<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;I understand that I am not authorized to complain, but what if other people are complaining?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Be rather coldly placating. Imagine what an artificial intelligence would do in your situation. Say some generic words of consolation but do not be too emotional, intimate, or unique in your response. Without being too direct about it, your (genuine) support is helping to teach people that they are not the only people who have ever undergone hardships and that humans are similar enough to each other for you to basically treat like hydra heads stemming from the same beast.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;Are you suggesting that I let people &#8216;cry it out&#8217; if they lament that they feel underappreciated or inconsolable?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Yes, but if you think they are in danger of physically harming themselves or people other than themselves, then I suggest you call the police and ask them to intervene. Hopefully you will never have to be placed in such a situation. I doubt that it is likely you will (especially if you keep to yourself as well as you do). Hence, because I think the likelihood is very small that you will have to report someone to the police, I think you can safely carry on as a non-interventionist in general and not worry too much about anything other than your own personal business (which you can quietly go about managing as you do not need anyone&#8217;s approval but your own (though you can consult paid experts, volunteers, and artificial intelligence for assistance and feedback if and when needed)).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_1: &#8220;Okay. One last thing: sometimes I think other people want me to complain or express weakness in some way. I generally do not feel comfortable doing that. What do you reckon I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes_0: &#8220;Well, if someone wants you to be a little bitch (like they really are inside or out), then I suggest that you perhaps sarcastically feign that you are not coping as effectively as you really are just to get them off your back (but do not be too obvious that you are merely acting &#8216;human&#8217; for their sake).&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I think it is time for me (the master of this website) to intervene. No, karbytes_0 does not have to feign weakness. That does not make the bullies any less cruel to you. It is better to be too much of a &#8216;real man&#8217; for them to want to disrespect. Who you really are inside is an exemplary example of what it means to be a man on the path towards <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-actualization</a> (which is a path whose length is infinitely long but where each genuine step forward along that path is genuinely moving closer to embodying superhuman ideals). Finally, it is important to emphasize that a &#8216;real man&#8217; (as opposed to just a male ape) is conscientious but not a pushover (and a &#8216;real man&#8217; does not need to loudly or aggressively advertise to other people his manliness and is otherwise not an attention whore nor a violent brute (because he reserves being violent only for defending himself and others from being attacked by others and not in a retaliatory nor territorial way)).&#8221;
