I took my bicycle into Sunnyvale REI today to get its flat tire repaired. While I waited for the repair to get done, I filled out more employment related forms which were sent to me by job recruiters to jobs I might be getting within the next two months. When I got my bike back, I was told that several parts on it were loose (and I said I’d come back later to get the bike tuned up (and I did not explain that the delay on the tune-up was due to me being chronically short on funds)). When I started riding the bike, it was apparent to me that the bike was not in as of good of condition as it was last time I rode it (which lead me to the conclusion that I’ll likely have to get it serviced for repairs soon and/or that I’ll have to get a new bike soon despite having bought it new less than four months ago).

To make matters worse, I was informed by my mom yesterday that Steve (i.e. the rent-paying housemate living at my dad’s house who allegedly befriended my dad when they were both in high school) will be required to move out in order to free up the room he is currently renting to be available for my brother when he comes to visit (and he is currently sharing a house in Los Angeles with close friends and he has a full-time office job). My mom told me yesterday that she will be moving into my dad’s house and renting out her current house to tenants in order to have more income available (especially to help me). She asked me several times if her moving into “my” house bothered me and I told her rather nonchalantly that it did not bother me and that it sounded like a reasonable idea (though I did not disclose to her that I did not want Steve to be forced to leave and that Daniel (i.e. my brother) might as well sleep on the couch, use my room (which I hardly spend any time in (and which I essentially only use as a place to store my personal belongings)), or rent a nearby hotel room).

I’ve been pretty obsessed with my financial situation and money in general lately. Perhaps I’ll strike some more variety and balance in my thought processes by doing some more academic activities (e.g. developing more software applications to feature in the section of my blog named SOFTWARE_ENGINEERING_PORTFOLIO, reading/watching intellectually-stimulating media from the World Wide Web, or even simply scrolling through social media feeds and forum posts (and I must say Bluesky dot Com has some especially good original content and seems to appeal to artists, comic writers, and opinionated types of people)).

This note does not seem to have much if any content which is relevant or useful to people other than karbytes and people who are interested in karbytes (unlike the karbytes-created web pages I’ve shared as posts on my social media platforms). Hence, I’ll just publish this note as a plain-text file and as a Hyper-Text-Markup-Language file in the “micro directory” named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_24 of the “macro directory” of my blog.

On second thought, I realized that many of the karbytes-created web pages I’ve shared as posts on my social media platforms (especially during the past month) are arguably not any less “special interest” to karbytes and karbytes fans only as this web page is. Hence, I might as well share it on my social media platforms.

Something I found online today on the blog section of Actualized dot Org is a picture quote about the universality of theft which does seem to pertain to humanity at large (and it is hard for me to think of any humans who are exempt from being thieves or leaches of other beings’ energy, time, and property. Hence, I will provide the Uniform Resource Locator to the screenshot image I made of that picture quote and which I uploaded to the public GitHub repository associated with the aforementioned “micro directory” section of my blogging website):

(Though it may seem farfetched to some people, I likened the idea of evicting single and/or elderly adults from a homeless shelter in Santa Clara County in order for families with minor children to take the place of those adults as being a form of theft against those displaced adults. It could also be argued that those displaced adults would have been stealing from those families with minor children if those displaced adults were not evicted to make way for those families with minor children who are arguably needier or more socially valuable (i.e. valued by the most people within the respective society). Who is most deserving of that limited space at the homeless shelter is a matter of subjective opinion, but in terms of how the encompassing civilization operates, those who have the most advocates vying for their welfare are generally treated as more deserving of welfare support than those who who do not have as many ambassadors vying for their welfare. The Uniform Resource Locator to the news story which discusses that event is displayed below and was shared as a social media item on three of my social media platforms).
