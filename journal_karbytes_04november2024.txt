To Whom It May Concern:

I will do my absolute best for now on to “keep to myself” (i.e. only interact with people other than myself as minimally as I deem necessary in order to ensure our common safety, common satisfaction, and common productivity (instead of willfully participating in interpersonal exchanges in which at least one party in such an exchange is being what I honestly deem to be excessively attention-seeking, antagonistic, deceitful, or otherwise wasteful of time, energy, money, or other valued and finite (in terms of availability) resources)).

This is not to say that my intention is to be an absolute hermit. Instead, what I intend to communicate in this note is that I prefer to maximize my access to solitary pastimes and to relying on people other than myself only as minimally as I deem necessary (all while spending some (but, preferably, not most) of my free time regularly in physical proximity to humans other than myself and sometimes interacting with them in a manner which is as mutually enjoyable and minimally demanding of time, energy, and economic investment as possible). Most of my “deep” interpersonal exchanges occur via the medium of the Internet and center around topics of common interest (excluding idle gossip, terrorism, and what I generally deem to be unethical behavior).

Lastly, I want to convey that my intentions include being single (rather than in a “committed relationship” with one or multiple people other than myself (and a “committed relationship” is not merely having a casual sexual encounter (whether one time only or multiple of such encounters in succession) nor merely having a platonic friendship centered around partaking in mutually enjoyable activities, common work projects, or discussions about various subject matter which are relatively impersonal and non-demanding of the listener’s time, energy, and economic investment, but instead, implicitly characterized by having to make significant investments towards each other in terms of time, energy, and economic investment (which I feel is too much like slavery for me to want to partake in)) for the remainder of my existence. I also intend to remain childless for the remainder of my existence and mostly (if not completely) celibate for the remainder of my existence.

Rather than make interpersonal relationships my highest priority in my life, I prefer to make my creative, intellectual, and employment-related work my highest priority in life. When I am not working, I prefer to be indulging in recreational activities, personal errands, and personal health maintenance activities. I hope and expect that what I do will result in making some kind of measurable and beneficial contribution to society at large such as paying some portion of my employment income back to the government as taxes which help pay for “social safety net” services and building/maintenance of public infrastructure and such as contributing useful educational or inspirational content on the public World Wide Web for anyone to freely access.

Sincerely,
