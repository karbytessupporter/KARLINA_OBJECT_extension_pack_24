Within a week of getting a flat tire on my bicycle (i.e. the front tire) I got another flat tire (i.e. the back tire) after riding my bike to the Philz Coffee in downtown Sunnyvale for a second time and leaving that bike parked (and locked) next to another bicycle (i.e. the same bicycle I saw parked there the last few times I visited that area). I also thought I overheard other people making condescending remarks about me. I spent a lot of time applying for jobs which were posted on Indeed dot Com today. I cannot help but feel that I definitely am being ganged up on by people who want me to remain unemployed and obstructed from achieving my goals in an efficient and joyful manner. My life seems to be getting more difficult over time instead of easier. Nevertheless, I'm trying the best I can to stay proactive and authentic instead of letting other people bully me out of bicycling or acting more fear-driven and compliant with their patriarchy. (It could be that I simply ran over thorns and that some or all of the flattened tire incidents were not human-intended. To people's faces I say I think I ran over a thorn or sharp object, but internally I think at least half of those tire flats were deliberately caused by humans who wanted to impede my "workflow" and cause me distress (in order to punish me for being "too happy" or "too functional functional" compared to what they are and/or want me to be)).
