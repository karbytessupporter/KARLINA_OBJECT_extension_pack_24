karbytes_0: "How much is too much meditation? How much is enough meditation? What is meditation?"

karbytes_1: "Too much meditation is what feels like a waste of time to the practioner of that meditation. Not enough meditation is the chronic condition of being unaware of one's own motivations and internal mental workings (and hence living as a puppet controlled by entirely external circumstances and authority figures other than one's own self). Meditation is the deliberate practice of paying attention to (mostly involuntary) stimuli including one's own sensory input (e.g. visual signals and auditory signals), one's own psychosomatic phenomena (e.g. emotions and "body load"), and mental activity (e.g. thoughts and dreams) and making that deliberate focusing of attention on present-moment stimuli (which is fundamentally transient or cyclical in nature) one's main activity during a particular time period."

karbytes_0: "Does practicing 'enough' meditation increase the practioner's free will?"

karbytes_1: "Yes, practing enough mediation will lead to an increase in the practioner's free will; at least at the level where free will (which is also referred to as agency) emerges as a virtual object rendered by relatively unconscious and relatively deterministic processes. At sufficiently macroscopic or at sufficiently microscopic levels of information processing, free will (i.e. agency) presumably does not exist (though one exception I could make is the hypothesis I have that sufficiently intelligent information processing agents can literally initiate deterministic causal chains and, hence, be godlike in a deistic sense by willfully creating phenomena out of literal nothingness merely by thinking and/or desiring such phenomena into existence)."
