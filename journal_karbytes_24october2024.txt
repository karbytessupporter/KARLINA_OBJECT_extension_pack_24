I do not really celibate the holidays.

Instead, I treat every day as a day which ought to be spent taking care of unfinished business while minimizing the waste of time, energy, and other resources whose availability is finite.

I do not really have physical nor emotional intimacy with any person other than myself. 

I could hence be accurately described as autosexual rather than merely asexual given that I occasionally masturbate (while being otherwise voluntarily celibate and voluntarily friendless (though I do consider myself as having people other than myself in my life who I regard as family members or acquaintances)).

Lastly, after spending approximately three consecutive days in the Castro Valley and Dublin region where my legal residence is located, I have come to the conclusion that I and my neighbors would be happiest with me keeping the curtains of my bedroom window permanently drawn shut instead or leaving them fully open as I have been doing.

(I started drafting this note while hiking downhill from the location along Ramage Peak trail where I recorded and uploaded to GitHub the following photographic images and panoramic video of what I assume is the highest elevation point along that trail (and the GitHub links to those raw files are available below this paragraph)):
