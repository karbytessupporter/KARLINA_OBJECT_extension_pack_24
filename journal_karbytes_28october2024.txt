Last night (or this morning) I had two rather vivid and meaningful dreams. The first dream occurred while I accidentally dozed off while watching a YouTube video I downloaded about the hypothetical phenomenon of "morphic fields". In that dream there was a small library full of books stacked on top of each other and the implication that there were children or young adults present (though no humans were visible from my vantage and I appeared to be taking the vantage of one of those people). I selected a book on top of a stack of books in the middle of the room whose cover looked exceptionally ornate and vintage. While I was somehow fetching the book, I heard a voice over which sounded like a narrator of that dream saying that I picked a book which most appealed to those high on estrogen. When I opened the book and started looking at the first few pages, I saw paintings of green pine forests and little variety between paintings as I flipped through the pages (and there were no words on the pages of that book). The book eventually started to resemble a flip-through animation when ghostly outlines of racial diverse women started to appear against the backdrop of the trees. Then a ghostly outline of a hedgehog spinning several times and turning into a giddy looking white man with brown head and facial hair appeared. Then more clay-mation-like depictions of a garden full of rotating green plant stems and other little cutesy-looking animals and plants appeared. Then I somehow was helping to complete the story by inserting tiny plastic animals which each had giddy facial expressions and a cartoonish aesthetic into the book and heard myself or the narrator in the background say that I was helping to populate the setting with as many animals as possible while casually ignoring overpopulation. I was aloof to what the moral of the "story" was and said I could use artificial intelligence to create more realistic and varied depictions of that part of the book/movie.

The second dream seemed to go on for a much longer time period than the first and seemed more eventful, interactive, and philosophically deep. I was apparently behind on two homework assignments I had yet to turn in online for a college-level mathematics class I was taking (and remember being told that it would not significantly affect my overall grade much to have one missing homework assignment but two missing could be problematic). I remember it being less than 24 hours before the deadline at 11:59PM on Saturday while it was Friday evening or Saturday morning simultaneously. I was downtown in some surrealist world which is resistant of both the baylands and some mountain town. There was a supermarket I was going into and saw that my housemate Steve had been able to get a second job working at the counter there simply by walking in and asking to work there. I was buying some food or other items there. Then I was somehow meeting up with my professor from that mathematics class and he was telling me about some dark things and I was somehow observing exactly what he was talking about in a "movie" which completely immersed me while I could still hear the professor talking. He was talking about a form of slowly murdering people (I think convicted felons) by first having them drink a poison or undergo some kind of targeted electric shock which causes just the few neurons in the prefrontal cortex which apparently are the basis for consciousness. Then, to test those people to see if they lost their consciousness and were hence rendered philosophical zombies, two of their fingers were placed in a device which cuts them off as soon as the person verbally consents to having those fingers cut off. The premise of the test was that only the philosophical zombies would consent to having their fingers cut off because, despite being able to talk and respond to stimuli from their environment, they, by definition of being philosophical zombies, have no awareness whatsoever. Otherwise, they would object to having their fingers cut off and would not follow instructions. The professor told me one subject of that test was particularly verbose despite being determined to be a philosophical zombie and that what he said was rather meaningful and disturbing due to the fact that, despite no longer having the neurons which would have imbued him with consciousness, he had built up a lot of memories in other parts of his brain which made him very intelligent-sounding and even threatening to the test administrators. Shortly after that I was reviewing the course website and saw how well the professor put it together. There was a section devoted just to showing the solution steps to the math problems the class found particularly difficult. There was a section on how the teacher generated software animations to depict mathematical concepts. Then I was waiting in a line outside with other class members for the professor to lead us somewhere and he said he would be back and said some cryptic comment about the price of vanity while walking away jovially.
