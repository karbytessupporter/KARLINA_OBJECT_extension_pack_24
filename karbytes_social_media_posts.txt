On 21_OCTOBER_2024 at approximately 8:30PM Pacific Standard Time, karbytes shared the following karbytes-created image and associated raw media file GitHub link as a social media post on karbytes' Bluesky dot Com page and on karbytes' Twitter dot Com page:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23/main/room_of_karbytes_closet_21october2024.jpg

(The significance of karbytes sharing that image on karbytes' "nerdiest" social media profiles is to commemorate the fact that, starting today, karbytes finally felt ready to fully inhabit its own room and make it a place karbytes can use its laptop computer to karbytes' content (in a private, cozy, nostaligic, minimalist, and aesthetically pleasing little housing unit). During the past four years, karbytes has spent most of its time living outdoors as a voluntary nomad due to the fact that karbytes' felt the need to leave its home and hometown in order to enjoy an adequate sense of privacy and exposure to the outside world (and to adventure and learning opportunities that are not available merely living at home or close to home) in the hopes that, after karbytes "graduates" from completing its "Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com degree" (i.e. completing a sufficient amount of updates to the body of intellectual property referred to as karbytes for the author of that body of intellectual property (i.e. karbytes) to feel that it has the equivalent of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Metaphysics, and Blogging), karbytes could comfortably inhabit its own room and not feel that it has "unfinished businees" left to complete as a nomad living primarly outside camping with its laptop computer and backpack).
