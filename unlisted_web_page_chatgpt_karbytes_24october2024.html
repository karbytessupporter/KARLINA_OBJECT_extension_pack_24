<p>The following conversation transcript was slightly modified for stylistic purposes and taken from a conversation had between karbytes and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT-4o</a> between 3:30PM Pacific Standard Time on 23_OCTOBER_2024 and 1:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 24_OCTOBER_2024. The conversation pertains to karbytes (this year) receiving two ballots for the same upcoming United States of America presidential election and wanting to know whether it is possible to electronically track a particular ballot after dropping it off at a post office box.</p>
<p>(Below the following conversation transcript are the web addresses of photographic images karbytes uploaded to GitHub of karbytes&#8217; two voting ballots received in the mail this year).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>Can voting ballots for the upcoming United States presidential election be electronically tracked by the voters which submit them via post office box drop off?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>Yes, in many states across the U.S., voters who submit their ballots via mail or drop-off boxes can track their ballots electronically. Each ballot typically has a unique barcode or tracking number, allowing voters to follow its progress from when it is received by the election office to when it is processed. This tracking can usually be done online through the state&#8217;s election website, and some states even offer notifications via email or text to inform voters when their ballot has been accepted and counted. It&#8217;s a good idea to check your state&#8217;s election office website for specific details on how to track your ballot.</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>I was mailed two separate voting ballots for the aforementioned election this year. The first ballot arrived via mail to my residence around February 2024 (and I filled that ballot out and dropped it off at a post office box within a month of receiving that ballot). I was mailed the second ballot within the past month (which is October 2024). I filled it out and dropped it off at a post office box within the past 24 hours (on the day 24_OCTOBER_2024). Is it normal for a citizen of the United States to receive two ballots for presidential elections?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but I cannot provide specific details about voting in the United States. I recommend visiting <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CanIVote.org</a> where you&#8217;ll find the latest information from your state or local election authority.</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>How many ballots per presidential election per voter is considered to be normal (either globally or just in the United States of America)?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but I cannot provide specific details about voting in the United States. I recommend visiting CanIVote.org where you&#8217;ll find the latest information from your state or local election authority.</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>How many ballots per presidential election per voter is considered to be normal (in general across the globe)?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>In general, across the globe, it is typical for each eligible voter to receive one ballot per election. This principle applies to presidential elections in most democratic countries, where one person gets one vote. If a voter receives more than one ballot, it could be due to clerical errors, issues with voter registration, or other administrative mistakes. In most cases, voting authorities have systems in place to detect and prevent multiple ballots from being counted for the same voter to avoid voter fraud.</p>
<p>If you receive multiple ballots, it&#8217;s advisable to contact your local election office to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>I decided not to bother contacting them so that I can get the power of two people while being just one (even though I do not expect Jill Stein to win the election).</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>Submitting multiple ballots for a single election is illegal in the United States and in most other countries. Each eligible voter is allowed only one vote per election to ensure fairness and integrity in the electoral process. If more than one ballot is submitted by a voter, election authorities are usually able to detect this, and it can lead to serious legal consequences, including penalties or criminal charges.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to ensure your vote is cast legally and within the guidelines of your local election laws, even if you support a candidate like Jill Stein or anyone else.</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the worst that could happen doing what I did?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>If you knowingly submit more than one ballot in an election, it is considered voter fraud, which is a serious offense in the United States and many other countries. The consequences can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances, but some potential outcomes include:</p>
<p>1. Criminal Charges: You could be charged with voter fraud, which is typically a felony. Felony convictions can result in significant penalties, including:</p>
<p>&#8211; Fines: These can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>&#8211; Imprisonment: Depending on the severity of the offense, you could face jail or prison time, sometimes up to several years.</p>
<p>2. Loss of Voting Rights: In many places, a felony conviction can lead to the loss of voting rights for a certain period of time, or even permanently, depending on the state&#8217;s laws regarding felons and voting.</p>
<p>3. Investigation: Even if your intention was not malicious, submitting multiple ballots could trigger an investigation. Election authorities could flag your ballots for review, potentially leading to legal scrutiny.</p>
<p>4. Public Record: A conviction for voter fraud could become part of your public record, potentially affecting future employment opportunities, your reputation, and other aspects of your personal and professional life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always best to act within the law to ensure the integrity of elections and avoid potential legal ramifications. Even if you don&#8217;t expect your preferred candidate to win, casting your vote once legally still contributes to the democratic process.</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>I doubt I will get persecuted. I will just say I thought I was get counted as two people as a social experiment by the deep state.</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>While it may seem unlikely that you would face legal consequences, it&#8217;s important to recognize that election authorities take voter fraud seriously, and even joking or misunderstanding the rules may not shield someone from legal accountability. Claiming that you thought it was a &#8220;social experiment&#8221; could be interpreted as an attempt to justify illegal actions, and authorities are unlikely to view this leniently if they discover a violation.</p>
<p>Even if the intention is not malicious, submitting multiple ballots is still illegal, and ignorance of the law or presenting a creative explanation would not typically prevent prosecution. Voter fraud investigations are designed to ensure election integrity, and being involved in one could have long-term consequences, including potential legal action, even if you believe your explanation is harmless.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s always best to correct any mistakes by contacting your local election office to clarify the situation, ensuring your vote is counted legally and avoiding any future issues.</p>

<p>The election process might as well be a joke if votes are still cast by paper instead of electronically like <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://singularityhub.com/2020/10/15/estonia-is-a-digital-republic-what-that-means-and-why-it-may-be-everyones-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what is done in Estonia</a>  (and any particular Estonian voter can submit as many ballots as they want per election period and have only the most recent ballot count). Paper ballots are too slow and expensive to move and too easy to miscount (unlike Internet-based voting like what is done in Estonia).</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>Estonia&#8217;s electronic voting system, known as i-Voting, is indeed considered one of the most advanced in the world. Voters can cast their ballots online using a secure identification system, and they are allowed to change their vote as many times as they wish within the voting period, with only the last vote being counted. This system offers convenience, speed, and cost-effectiveness compared to paper-based voting.</p>
<p>However, other countries, including the U.S., have been slower to adopt similar systems due to concerns over cybersecurity, voter privacy, and the potential for hacking or election interference. While paper ballots may seem outdated, they offer a tangible and verifiable record of each vote, which is especially valuable in contested elections where recounts may be necessary. Paper ballots also provide a level of security against certain types of cyber threats that purely electronic systems could face.</p>
<p>Implementing a fully electronic voting system on a large scale, especially in countries as large as the U.S., would require overcoming significant technical, logistical, and security challenges. While Estonia&#8217;s system is admired, other countries may weigh the benefits and risks differently based on their specific circumstances.</p>
