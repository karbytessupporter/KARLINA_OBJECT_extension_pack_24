karbytes_0: "The more happy a human is, the less motivated that human is to cause some human other than itself to suffer more than it currently is."

karbytes_1: "Is the inverse also true?"

karbytes_0: "Yes. The less happy a human is, the more motivated that human is to cause some human other than itself to suffer more than it currently is."

karbytes_1: "Why is that?"

karbytes_0: "The reason for that phenomenon is that there is only a finite (and historically scarce) availability of coveted material commodities, coveted services, and coveted infrastructural support to satisfy each human which is currently alive inside of a civilization system (i.e. economy, government, and physical spaces of habitation, commodity consumption, and commodity procurement). Hence, humans have learned that not all humans are able to be sufficiently happy to not harbor animosity and motivation to inflict suffering on humans other than themselves for human civilization to be truly devoid of hostile or vengeful members."

I wrote the section of this note above this section of this note while walking my bicycle from the Amazon warehouse in Milpitas, California to the Warm Springs BART station in Fremont, California. Along the way I noticed many rude blue collar men driving and presiding over public spaces while being loud, smoking their cigarettes, saying rude things (mostly gossip, taunts, and attention-seeking things). I also noticed the precise moment when I think my front bike tire got punctured: at the west entrance of Coyote Creek Trail and over a shard of broken glass (which I noticed a growing number of throughout the regions I have been bicycling over the past four months).

I noticed some of the women in these ghettos are ugly, talk excessively (seemingly only to fight with someone or to gossip), and act like absolute cucks to the patriarchy. I noticed some of the men in these ghettos walk with a swagger (i.e. moving their shoulders in an exaggerated manner and walking with some kind of chauvinistic and schadenfreude-driven bounce in their step). I blame those types of slovenly (almost "sub human") apes for making the world I live in so polluted, crime-filled, and strewn with bicycling hazards. If it were up to me, I would make it a serious and punishable crime for any human to get itself or someone else pregnant (in ways which are deemed by the state to be voluntarily committed by that person) without a permit from the government (and one permit per each attempted and/or successful pregnancy). That way, only the most civic-minded, mentally healthy, educated, and financially responsible people would be allowed to be the stewards of society's future adult members (instead of letting parasitic, incompetent, and likely abusive humans to make livestock from their loins out of hedonistic negligence and perhaps for political reasons (i.e. using kids or pregnancies as pawns to exploit the system or people other than themselves)).
The temporal length of the walk from the Milpitas Amazon warehouse to the Warm Springs BART station was approximately one hour and thirty minutes.

Finally, I thought I should mention that I heard several of the "monkey men" say that I have no right to smile nor to be genuinely upbeat (especially for futuristic reasons). I see that "their" women almost always seem subdued and almost melancholy (but nonchalant with a hint of embittered sass (which I think translates to sexual availability and compliance with heterosexual ghetto male desire)). Those women seem to be demonically possessed by the patriarchy and hence making hideous fools of themselves; looking and behaving like unfunny clowns and rowdy, bratty chimps or young children in need of an authority figure to calm them down and to give them something to look forward to and to live to be seen by, desired by, and "protected" by. 

Those people (the males and the females but especially the males) are aggressive attention whores which seriously inconvenience me and which almost always get away with such insolence. I am documenting this shit to let it be known to the general public that I know such antics are taking place and commonplace (at least at this time and place in human civilization).

Thankfully, I know about and am involved with humans who are what I deem to be much higher quality than the degenerates I mentioned in this note. That is the main reason I am more happy than sad. Such people (who I say imbue my life with perhaps most of its happiness) are passionately devoted to the same interests and causes I am (especially technology, science, philosophy, and ideas about what makes a utopian civilization).

Last night while I was browsing my Instagram feed, I noticed a video which apparently featured Donald Trump's voice disclosing his secrets for success in a short motivational video (but the voice seemed artificial-intelligence-generated to me). I could not disagree with most if not all of the tenets disclosed in that video (which I thought were refreshingly candid and straightforward about the human condition), especially the premise that people (i.e. humans) are generally not happy for the success of other humans and that people often like to sabotage other people's success (and "Trump's" insinuation was that it is a good idea to not celebrate one's victories or good fortune too publicly). Another tenet in that video I found to be quite true (even though "liberals" might be adverse to admit it) is that, if a person does not "keep up with the herd", that person will be "left behind". In other words, people who do not prove to be sufficiently self-sufficient and useful to the populace will most likely be treated as an invalid, burden, or criminal to be ignored, quarantined, crippled, or exterminated.
