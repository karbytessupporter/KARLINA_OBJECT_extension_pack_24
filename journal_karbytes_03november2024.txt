I would say that the previous "micro directory" of my blog was akin to completing the construction of my house and that this "micro directory" of my blog is akin to making that house into a home.

The previous "micro directory" (which is named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23) contains the (Hyper-Text-Markup-Language (whose file extension is ".html")) source code files for each of the software engineering tutorial web pages of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com (because I updated each of those software engineering tutorial web pages as of 17_OCTOBER_2024 (and I do not expect to ever update those web pages again after 17_OCTOBER_2024)).

The previous "micro directory" (which is named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23) also contains the (Hyper-Text-Markup-Language (whose file extension is ".html")) source code files for each of the software engineering tutorial web pages of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com which were most recently updated on or before 22_OCTOBER_2024 (and I do not expect to ever update those web pages again after 22_OCTOBER_2024).

This "micro directory" (which is named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_24) contains content whose data size is neither the smallest for a "micro directory" nor the largest for a "micro directory" (where a "micro directory" is one of the web pages listed in the "macro directory" of this website (and a "micro directory" listed on the "macro directory" is prefaced with the label "RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MICRO_DIRECTORY_" concatenated with that "micro directory"'s uniquely corresponding nonnegative integer index number)). For the sake of keeping karbytes content easy to archive and navigate, I intend to keep all "micro directories" of this website within the current "micro directory" data size range (and this website encompasses all of karbytes (and this website is named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com and its one and only "macro directory" section (which is listed on the home page of this website) neatly encapsulates all the source code files and media files which comprise the public domain and public World Wide Web hosted digital file collection named karbytes (and that collection includes the entirety of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and the entirety of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com and each of those files is hosted inside of GitHub respositories on the GitHub dot Com account whose username is @karlinarayberinger (and each of those GitHub repositories is intended by karbytes to be downloaded as a zip file and burned to one or else multiple M_DISCs for safekeeping offline as soon as is feasible for karbytes to implement)))).

This "micro directory" (which is named raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_24) contains content which established karbytes' personal and professional identity to karbytes' satisfaction (which means that, after this "micro directory" is finalized (and after all of the karbytes content generated before 01_JANUARY_2025 is burned to a single 25 gigabyte capacity M_DISC named karbytes_2024_0), karbytes might take a temporary or permanent hiatus from making updates to the aforementioned body of intellectual property named karbytes (though karbytes does expect to take only a temporary hiatus because (a) karbytes loves adding new content to that intellectual property collection for the sake of preserving karbytes' most cherished and digitizable knowledge and (b) karbytes thinks that making updates to that collection at least once per month helps to comfort and inspire karbytes and fans of karbytes by letting them know that karbytes is still alive and continuing to learn, create, and find a sense of amusement or purpose in existence (and karbytes wants to "be there" for whoever karbytes' fans are (and those fans include karbytes itself) or, at the very least, leave a potentially immortal legacy on the public World Wide Web for any person to discover and download and perhaps use as a "pocket friend" (i.e. someone who gives them a sense of having another person to compare themselves to and take interest in)))).

Lastly, on karbytes' "big picture" record-keeping GitHub dot Com account (and whose username is @karbytessupporter), there will probably only be four pinned GitHub repositories (i.e. GitHub repositories which are featured prominently on the profile page of a GitHub dot Com user account). Those pinned GitHub repositories highlight what karbytes thinks are the most essential or formative content of karbytes (and those GitHub repositories are named (a) development_space, (b) KARLINA_OBJECT, (c) raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_23, and (d) raw_github_files_directory_KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_24).
