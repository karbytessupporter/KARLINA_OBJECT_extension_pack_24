To Whom It May Concern:

Within the past 24 hours I decided to implement a new content management policy of setting each one of my GitHub repositories to read-only (i.e. archive) mode immediately after I make an update to that GitHub repository. Then, when I want to make another update to that GitHub repository, I unarchive that repository before making the update and then proceed to make that update before, again, setting that GitHub repository to read-only mode. 

The purpose of implementing the aforementioned new policy is to help me keep track of when (i.e. what day within a particular month and year (e.g. 25_OCTOBER_2024)) I most recently updated a particular karbytes-created (and hence karbytes-owned) GitHub repository.

Sincerely,
karbytes
