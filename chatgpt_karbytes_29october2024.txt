How do employment agencies work and are they free to use?

ChatGPT:

Employment agencies help job seekers find positions and assist companies in filling their vacancies. Here’s a breakdown of how they work:

1. Services for Job Seekers: Employment agencies match job seekers to positions that fit their skills, experience, and career goals. Agencies often help with resume editing, interview preparation, and providing career advice.

2. Client Companies: Companies partner with agencies to find qualified candidates efficiently, particularly for roles that are hard to fill or require specialized skills.

3. Types of Placements: Agencies offer a range of placements:

- Temporary: Short-term assignments, often covering an immediate need.

- Temp-to-Perm: Temporary roles that may lead to permanent positions.

- Direct Hire: Permanent placements where the agency screens candidates and the company hires directly.

4. Cost to Job Seekers: Employment agencies are typically free for job seekers. They make money from fees charged to the companies seeking employees, not from candidates. However, certain specialized or executive recruitment agencies might charge candidates for services like career coaching, but this is uncommon.

Using an agency can be a helpful way to access hidden job markets, especially if you’re looking for temp or specialized positions. Just be sure to research the agency’s reputation, as some may operate differently or specialize in certain industries.
